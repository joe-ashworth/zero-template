      <h3>Main Content</h3>
      <p><img class="pic-small-left" src="images/pagepic1.jpg" alt="Tree"/>This column is an article defined by a class that floats left and has a width of 75%. It can be used inside any size container.</p>
      <p>This site serves as a quick and simple starter code set for creating a new project. It has many elements that are necessary for most traditional layouts.</p>
      <p>The navigation, slider, and layout elements have their own pages that describe their implementations and reference for modification. </p>
      <p>Some pages may have layouts that don't directly compliment the content. The content of this site is not related to the design elements since all of this verbiage should be replaced or sections removed. More than a strict layout to drop content into, this site should become tweakable in every way quickly since the code is so straight-forward and generic. The stylesheet can be  viewed at <a href="css/styles.css">/css/styles.css</a>.</p>
      <div class="group pad-vert">
        <div class="col-one-half">
          <p>You could  split this main column into two half columns. This is the first half with a width of 50%. Padding is provided by the p tag. To use backgrounds on these divs, you would want containers that allow for a gutter between them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-one-half">
          <p>You could even split this main column into two half columns. This is the first half with a width of 50%. Padding is provided by the p tag. These two divs are wrapped in a .group div to auto-clear their floats without affecting the elements that follow.</p>
        </div>

      <h3>Development Cycle &amp; Workflow</h3>
      <ul>
      	<li>Identify project stage to determine workflow. Initial Design, Build-out, Production.</li>
      	<li>Currently refining a process that replaces Dreamweaver with Brackets. WAMP works great for me where XAMPP has been giving me problems when modifying http.conf to change project location. Brackets has a buit-in previewer that is amazing, but falls short of Prepros once pages are sliced into php includes.</li>
      	<li>WAMP modification: Configure the http.conf file within Apache in WAMP to point to root of all project files. For me, all of my sites are in folders within a folder named <em><strong>sites</strong></em>. So I changed WAMP document root in http.conf (in 2 places) from the default install location to F:/sites. Then I can view a project by going to http://localhost/sitefoldername.      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Project Stages</h3>
      <ul>
      	<li><strong>Initial Design:</strong> This is the barebones creation of a home page and a single subpage to be duplicated. It is done entirely in Brackets using its preview tool. Once a good home page and sub page have been completed, it's time to begin Build-Out</li>
      	<li><strong>Build-Out:</strong> This stage is for extracting html into php includes and duplicating pages as needed. Now that pages are php, we move to WAMP and Prepros and discontinue using Brackets' preview. Prepros is configured to run its preview at the localhost address from WAMP. </li>
      	<li><strong>Pre-Production:</strong> When all pages are in place with dummy content, open the site in Dreamweaver to enter actual content. Dreamweaver is superior for entering and tweaking text. Its preview pane works great  by wrapping text in p tags or entering link hrefs from the properties panel.</li>
      	<li><strong>Production:</strong> When the site is live, it is an official production site. Dreamweaver is used to FTP upload directly and make changes as needed.      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>General suggestions for markup and styling that make life easier</h3>
      <ul>
      	<li>Avoid static widths whenever possible. Use percentages.</li>
        <li>Try to use padding to move things around whenever possible. </li>
        <li>Try to avoid adding left or right margins or padding to block elements (mostly containers). They add size to the element. A div that is 25% wide with a 1% margin (or padding) actually uses 27%. Pad the contents instead if necessary.</li>
        <li>Try to avoid margins on containers unless you accomodate for the behavior of margins from 2 different elements touching. Learn the displacement differences between padding and margins to avoid strange problems</li>
        <li>Floats can be cleared automatically using the .group style on the parent container (see stylesheet).</li>
        <li>Try to get acquainted with using em instead of px on text or most anywhere possible. pixels are rigid, ems fluctuate with text size. Style the body element with a text size or simply... text-size:100%;</li>
        <li>Use a set of classes for columns that define width. Using .one-fourth, .one-third, .two-thirds, .one-half, etc. throughout the site gives you a way to tweak breakpoints across the whole site quickly.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <aside class="col-one-fourth">
      <h3>Quarter Column</h3>
      <p>This column is an aside that is defined by a class that floats left and has a width of 25%. It can be used inside any size container.</p>
      <p>This particular layout isn't very good for a home page. Usually a full width page with some big boxes that highlight the main content looks better. Maybe some large font slogan that fills the full width also. </p>
      <p>Try to avoid thin columns like this one on the home page if you have enough content and imagery to fill the full width without a wall of text.</p>
      <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
      <p>I played with SASS and JADE for a bit, and I may continue using them for super-fast prototyping or for pre-initial design. Brackets preview tool is so good with raw html and css that I don't want to miss out on it by using SASS/JADE.</p>
      <p>I'm also starting to focus on true semantic markup. This means using article, header, footer, nav, section, and aside tags more freely. Since I don't attach any styles to divs specifically, it doesn't matter what I use to replace them (style-wise).</p>
      <p>I'm building a replacement for grids. Frameworks and Boilerplates are full of unnecessary code and nested divs that are just ugly, but I need a meaningful way to make multiple columns size properly under changing widths, so I'm writing a healthy block of css that will manage 3 variants of floating columns with quarters, thirds, halves and maybe fifths and sixths.</p>
    </aside>
  </div>
  <footer class="group">
    <article class="col-one-third">
      <p>Three simple columns can fill the footer by creating three divs and assigning them the class of col-one-third that floats left and has a width of 33% each. Try to adjust vertical content to the same number of text lines if at all possible for better appearance.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="col-one-third">
      <p>The content in these divs should fill the div as closely as possible. Contact info that is left justified will make the div seem off balance if there is no content on the right side. The p tag padding handles the gaps. Target the footer p to adjust.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="col-one-third">
      <p>If using one of these divs for contact info, consider right floating a map image or simple logo on the left to keep content wide. This last div has a 1% leftover since each is only 33%. Consider adding a class to this div that changes width to 34%.</p>
